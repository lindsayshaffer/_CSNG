Our lab focuses on topics related to **elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition in humans**. We focus on a variety of techniques such as **computational modeling, behavioral paradigms, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimuluation (TMS)**.

Please see below for current projects in the lab.


### Parent-adolescent interactions (PAIT Study)
Supported by NIDA (5R01DA033431-08) and in collaboration with [Dr. Tara Chaplin](https://yel.gmu.edu/our-team/) in Clinical Psychology. Research has demonstrated that poor parenting is a major risk factor for adolescent substance abuse risk, but the mechanisms for parenting effects on substance use are not known. The PAIT Study will examine emotion- and reward-related brain mechanisms of effects of parenting on adolescent substance use and gender differences in these mechanisms. Findings will identify gender-sensitive brain-based mechanisms of parenting effects, which can be used to develop stronger personalized parenting intervention programs and to develop gender-sensitive interventions. 

For this longitudinal study, we are current enrolling adolescents between the ages of 12-14 years old and their parents.
